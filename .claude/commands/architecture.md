We're architecting the layout of an application that will use Next.js 14+ with TypeScript for the frontend and NestJS 10+ with TypeScript and PostgreSQL (via Prisma ORM) for the backend. Authentication will be handled via Privy where all users have an embedded wallet created for them and can login with their email, Google or Apple OAuth.

I need you to help me create an architecture diagram of how this will look and identify any key architecture decisions that were missed. For any that were missed you must ask for my guidance on how to implement them.
